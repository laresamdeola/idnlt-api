import fetch from 'node-fetch'
import express from "express"

const app = express()

const idnlt = "https://idnlt-api2.herokuapp.com/infections"

***the aysnc function to fetch the data from the api***

const fetchData = async (url) => {
  try{
    let response = await fetch(url)
    let data = await response.json()
    console.log(data)
  } catch(error){
    console.log(error.message)
  }
}

***the get route***

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const displayData = fetchData(idnlt)
  console.log(displayData)
